    <h1>Sensotrend</h1>
    <p class="ingress">Sensotrend makes life with diabetes easier by visualizing data and deriving
      actionable insights from dozens of medical devices and wellness trackers and facilitating
      sharing the information with healthcare professionals and peers.</p>
    <p>Sensotrend is one of the first health related use cases in the <a
      href="https://www.gaia-x.eu">Gaia-X network</a>, a winner of the <a
      href="https://www.sitra.fi/en/projects/the-fair-health-data-challenge/">Fair Health Data
      Challenge</a> by Sitra, and a founding member of the <a href="https://www.mydata.org">MyData
      Global</a> organization. Data exchange is in the core of what we do, so HL7
      FHIR<sup>&reg;</sup> really matters to us!
    </p>
    <p>We show how our suite of software products has been connected with most of the platforms in
      the project.</p>
    <ul id="products">
      <li><a href="https://www.sensotrend.fi/connect/">Sensotrend Connect</a> transfers data from
        cloud services of medical device vendors to healthcare organizations so that it can be
        connected to clinical workflows.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sensotrend.fi/uploader/">Sensotrend Uploader</a> is a computer
        application transferring data from glucometers, continuous glucose monitors, and insulin
        pumps.</li>
        <li><a href="https://nightscout.fi/index">Nightscout Connect</a> extends the support for
          devices to the filed of open source innovation. Nightscout is a community of tens of
          thousands of people developing and using open source solutions for remote glucose
          monitoring and automated insulin delivery.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sensotrend.fi/dashboard/">Sensotrend Dashboard</a> visualizes data
        both from medical devices and from wellness trackers. It provides actionable insights, and
        facilitates sharing data with healthcare professionals and peers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We share our experiences from integrating our products with various platforms using the FHIR
      standard.
    </p>
    <p>We map data from proprietary formats of device manufacturers into FHIR format so it can be
      stored to any FHIR server and used from there by multiple apps.</p>
    <p>Thanks to SMART App Launch, a clinician can launch a patient's view on the Sensotrend
      Dasboard from an electronic health record system with a single click.</p>
