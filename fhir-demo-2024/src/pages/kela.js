        <h2>Kanta Personal Health Record (Omatietovaranto)</h2>
        <p>Kanta Personal Health Record (Kanta PHR) is a national Kanta service in which users can
        save their wellbeing data. The service was deployed for the first-phase production use in
        spring 2018. Currently, citizens can record their wellbeing data in Kanta PHR with accepted
        wellbeing applications developed for this purpose.</p>
        <p>In the future, users may give their consent to healthcare and social welfare
        professionals to use the data in support of their patient care or service relationship.</p>
        <p>Anyone can develop a new wellbeing application that utilises Kanta PHR. The applications
        can be server-based or mobile applications. Their users may consist of citizens
        professionals or both. For wellbeing application suppliers, Kanta PHR offers the interfaces
        and the open national accepted data content based on the HL7 FHIR standard. The FHIR Rest
        API interfaces are specified in the Capability Statement description. The data content is
        developed in cooperation with various actors.</p>
        <p>Application developers can integrate their own application in the sandbox environments
        of Kanta PHR for independent testing. Further information: <a
        href="https://www.kanta.fi/en/system-developers/sandbox-environments">Sandbox
        environments</a>.</p>
        <p>Further information about the service and the latest updates are available on the <a
        href="https://www.kanta.fi/en/system-developers/kanta-phr">Kanta PHR page</a>.</p>
        <p>Demo: The Sandbox can be used in the demo as is. Kela will also demonstrate in the
        MyKanta how users can browse their wellbeing data and store results from their
        measurements.</p>

        <h2>Kanta Prescription centre FHIR interface</h2>
        <p>Prescription centre is a national Kanta service in which citizens' electronic
        prescriptions and electronic dispensations are saved. Main interfaces in production are
        based on HL7 V3 Medical Records messaging and HL7 V3 CDA R2 documents. For metadata search
        of the prescriptions has been implemented search operation based on FHIR custom operations
        and FHIR Medication*-resources. FHIR interface includes only metadata of the prescription
        although the data content of the metadata includes a large amount of information of the
        actual prescription.</p>
        <p><a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/finnishkantamedicationr4/home?version=current">For
        this interface</a> there is no open Sandbox environment available. The interface can be
        used only through the Kanta <a

        <p>Demo: The Kanta services can produce examples of FHIR MedicationRequest resource

        <h2>Other Kanta FHIR interfaces in the future</h2>
        <p>In the future there is a plan to offer data of the Kanta services in FHIR format. This
        data can be for example diagnoses (problems), lab results, vital sign from Patient data
        archive service.</p>
        <p>Demo: Kanta services can produce several example FHIR resource instances for demo
        purpose and these instances can be made available through a server of another party
        participating in the demo or through public FHIR servers.</p>
